## How to contribute ?

We greatly appreciate your interest in contributing to the wax-mnist project of collecting wax images on Github. This project aims to create a comprehensive database of wax images that can be used for various purposes, including research, education, and training. There are many ways that you can contribute to this project, whether you have a new image to add or other contributions to improve the image database.

If you have a new image that you would like to add to the database, the first step is to ensure that the image meets the project's guidelines and criteria. This includes ensuring that the image is of high quality, relevant to the project's scope, and properly categorized. Once you have confirmed that your image meets these requirements, you can submit it to the project's repository on Github, either by creating a pull request or by contacting the project maintainers directly.

In addition to adding new images, you can also contribute to the project by helping to improve the existing image database. This could involve tasks such as reviewing and categorizing images, adding metadata or annotations to images, or developing new tools or algorithms to enhance the image analysis capabilities of the database. If you have expertise in image processing, computer vision, or related fields, your contributions in this area could be particularly valuable.

Finally, you can also contribute to the project by sharing your feedback and ideas with the community. Whether you have suggestions for new features or improvements to the project, or just want to share your experiences using the wax-mnist image database, your feedback can help to shape the future direction of the project.

Thank you again for your interest in contributing to the wax-mnist project of collecting wax images on Github.
